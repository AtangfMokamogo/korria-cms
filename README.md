:exclamation: ```NOTE TO ALX REVIEWER```
> This Project is an initial test implementation of the **Headless CMS**. While the functionality discussed in this document is works as expected, There were some noticeable pain points during development that kept the API implementation at a minimal state. That being said, i found it necessary to begin the project on a new slate. Please see attached github repo below to view the current state of implementation
